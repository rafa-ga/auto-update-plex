# Plex auto-updater.

Simple script to add in crontab.
It is intended for Debian-based systems, but can be easily adapted to other distros.
The repository consists of 2 files:

- Automation script.
- Log file (automatically created with the first entry).

I'm not a developer, please don't blame me haha.
